Caelum


Caelum is a groundbreaking innovation in Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology.
Using advanced computer simulation models, Caelum has been recognized as an effective method of Carbon Capture, performing similarly to and better than many industry DAC methods.
Caelum uses Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) and Calcium Hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) in alkaline solutions to capture carbon dioxide using chemical absorption, and processes it into Calcium Carbonate in chemcial reactors.
